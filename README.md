       └─ NginxProxy         → data plane config (Service, Deployment, NGINX settings)




## What `NginxGatewayFabric` is

It's the **operator's umbrella CR** — the single object you create and edit, which the Helm-based operator expands into a full NGF installation. The NGINX Gateway Fabric Operator deploys and manages one or more NGINX Gateway Fabric control planes, which in turn handle the NGINX/NGINX Plus deployments. Each `NginxGatewayFabric` you create = one complete NGF install (one control plane + its config).

Crucially, it **owns and generates** the other two CRDs. You saw this directly in the NginxProxy YAML dump the other day — its `ownerReferences` pointed back at `kind: NginxGatewayFabric`. So the hierarchy is:

```
NginxGatewayFabric              ← you edit THIS (operator/Helm-values layer)
  └─ owns & generates ─┐
       ├─ NginxGateway       → control plane config (logging level)
       └─ NginxProxy         → data plane config (Service, Deployment, NGINX settings)
```

Editing `NginxGateway`/`NginxProxy` directly gets reconciled away — they're outputs, not inputs. The operator CR's `spec.nginxGateway.*` feeds the NginxGateway; its `spec.nginx.*` feeds the NginxProxy.


## NginxGatewayFabric vs NginxGateway vs NginxProxy

| | **NginxGatewayFabric** | NginxGateway | NginxProxy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Role | Operator umbrella / install CR | Control plane config | Data plane config |
| You edit it? | **Yes — this is the input** | No (generated) | No (generated) |
| Group/Version | `gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1` | `gateway.nginx.org` (confirm) | `gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha2` |
| Owns | NginxGateway + NginxProxy | — | — |
| Typical contents | `spec.nginxGateway.*`, `spec.nginx.*`, `plus`, image, replicas | `logging.level` | `kubernetes.*`, `ipFamily`, `disableHTTP2`, metrics, telemetry |
| Wired up by | OLM / the operator | controller `--nginx-gateway-config-name` | GatewayClass `parametersRef` or a Gateway |
| Count in your cluster | **2** (nginx-gateway, crapi) | 1 per fabric instance | 1 per fabric instance |

So the mental model: `NginxGatewayFabric` is the dial you turn; `NginxGateway` and `NginxProxy` are the readouts it drives, one per plane.

Want to check the crAPI install's current state before we start the walk, or confirm the operator's install mode first so you know exactly what the upgrade will touch?
